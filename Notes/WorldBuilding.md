# World building (origin of superhumans)

## Old idea

- A god becomes sentient in a parallel dimension, maybe the previous one died long ago
- He sees a previous god lies dead not far beside him. He doesn't care
- 12th dimension, in ref to M-string theory having 11
- It is similar to a child psychologically.
- Looks like a human, has kind of god powers, and can pull humans into his dimension, but cannot cross into the other dimension of humans.
- It is bored, finds humans (which look like him for some reason) and kidnaps some he likes into his dimension before their death; they believe it is heaven
- In his vicinity, humans become stronger and acquire powers.
- His close allies become sort of demigods and form his pantheon
- A human realizes this god sees humans as only playthings and that life is not eternal for everyone. Plus, he discovers the ancient god's corpse, signifying this god isn't the one true eternal
  - Kills the god and splits his corpses into pieces: god remnants
  - Weapon used: bone knife from the bones of the previous god
  - He throws the god remnants onto earth, in the hopes that the demigods won't find them
  - He hopes humans will find an answer to what he his
- Is found by the other demigods, he is killed in retribution. They panick when they see their god is dead, try to keep the status quo because they are addicted to their newfound power
- They try to stop John Doe from publishing his findings on the 12th dimension
- They also want to recover the fallen god's remnants

## Current idea

### Ancient times

- A god presided over a city of humans (egyptian/mesopotamian in my head)
  - Generic huge bearded guy? or a golem?
  - Antlantis
- It can grant powers to humans, making them demigods
- He is betrayed by one of his former followers, his body is separated into many different pieces and spread across the world
  - They fossilise, but still retain mystic power &rarr; **mystic remnants**
- Atlantis falls into chaos, without the god it sinks into the sea and is only remembered in myths

### Historic time

- Some human clans find **mystic remnants**, which bestow power to their wielder
  - Remnants can be split to share the power, or combined to make the user more powerful &rarr; a **Magus**
- Many of these clans attempt to leverage this power, but the last surviving demigods chase them incessantly to increase their own powers and rival one another.
- Demigods hide their true nature, and hide in the monarchic families of different countries

### Current time

- Because of democraties, demigods have been driven out of positions of power, and are in hiding
  - Governments search and destroy them, as they are dangerous
- Only a few mystic clans remain, and hide in order to avoid persecution from either human governments or demigods. They do not want to lose their mystic power
- Modern technology now makes single humans able to rival against a mystically powered person
